# Welcome

I live on la frontera,  
in the spaces between  
heart and mind,  
poetry and pose,  
virtuality and touch,  
fear and action,  
impossibility and unstoppability.  
  
I live where skin meets stone.  
  
In juxtaposition,  
paradox,  
תקון עולם

Join me on the journey through  
the ecotones of the human spirit.
