    <div class="about-text">
        <p>As a 4th-generation Colorado native and Denver Public Schools alum, I have deep roots in our community. After graduating high school, I studied environmental biology and community organizing in the INVST program at University of Colorado-Boulder.</p>
        
        <p>I left the country soon after college to serve as a Peace Corps volunteer in Guatemala where I began my teaching career and journey to be bilingual. As a life-long learner, I earned a Master's in Educational Psychology and completed the Principal Licensure program at CU-Denver.</p>
        
        <p>I am an assistant principal of Barney Ford Elementary School. Every day I work to create inclusive, equitable learning environments where all students can thrive.</p>
        
        <p>I live in the spaces between cultures, languages, and perspectives - finding beauty in the liminal places where transformation happens.</p>
