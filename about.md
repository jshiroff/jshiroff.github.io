# About

I am a catalyst for helping students, families, and communities achieve healing, wholeness, and joy.

As a 4th-generation Colorado native and Denver Public Schools alum, I have deep roots in our community. After graduating high school, I studied environmental biology and community organizing in the INVST program at University of Colorado-Boulder. I left the country soon after college to serve as a Peace Corps volunteer in Guatemala where I began my teaching career and journey to be bilingual. As a life-long learner, I earned a Masterâ€™s in Educational Psychology and completed the Principal Licensure program at CU-Denver.

I am an assistant principal of Barney Ford Elementary School. Everyday I feel deeply grateful to be a father of two amazing children and spouse to a Kate Shiroff. I enjoy exercising, spending time in nature, traveling, riding bicycles, reading, and relaxing in a hammock whenever possible.

I live, teach, and lead with the belief that community, interdependence, and courage inspire personal transformation. Supporting each other makes us all more complete & our world more just and sustainable.
